# UX Design

### What is UX design?

Our UX design team craft beautiful and intuitive experiences that solve real user needs.

### Our Competencies

<Card>

#### <Icon path={mdiSquareOffOutline} size={2} /> Wireframing

We start by creating the structural flow of a product as simply as possible. We consider the goals, risks and challenges a user might face at each step.

This gives us the flexibility to take a step back before committing to a set style. We research, validate and make changes to the flow as quickly and efficiently as possible.

[Contact us](mailto:hello@zero-1.studio) for help with Wireframing.

#### <Icon path={mdiCellphoneLink} size={2} /> Prototyping

We create end-to-end experiences using low-code or no-code solutions.

This allows us to check the effectiveness of the product in a mock environment, before commmitting to costly development.

**Our prototyping stack**

- Figma
- Adobe XD
- Bubble.io
- WebFlow
- ProtoPie
