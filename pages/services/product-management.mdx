# Product Management

### What is Product Management?

Product Management ensures the products we build truly meet the needs of users and businesses. 

It is the foundation of everything we do at Zero 1; we believe that great Product Management is absolutely necessary in creating exceptional Products.

### Our Competencies

**Example Deliverables**

#### <Icon path={mdiHeadDotsHorizontal} size={2} /> Product Strategy

So, you have a well defined vision for your product. How on earth do you make it happen?

This is where Product Strategy comes in; we create tangible plans that lead toward the Product Vision. Our strategies are based on outcomes, not outputs or features.

**Example Deliverables**
- Lean UX Canvas
- User Personas
- Product Roadmap (outcome based)

In Product Discovery we create hypotheses about how we might achieve the outcomes defined in the Product Strategy.

We look to ideate and test ideas in a matter of hours and days, testing as many ideas as possible in order to discover the ones that are truly effective.

**Example Deliverables**
- Ideation Workshops
- User Research
- Prototypes
- Opportunity Solution Tree
